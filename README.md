# Music-Mental-Health
This is a self-initiated personal project to test my technical knowledge, as well as to fulfill my keen interest for both music and psychology. I have developed music genre recommendation model for individuals with certain mental health conditions using Python loops. Next, I've leveraged advanced Excel for data cleaning and wrangling. Next, designed user-friendly website with HTML and hosted on AWS S3 to facilitate accessibility and usage. Last but not least, I have visualized general statistics with Tableau and made automated process for survey results using UiPath.
